Cluster mode in VictoriaLogs provides horizontal scaling to many nodes when [single-node VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/)
reaches vertical scalability limits of a single host. If you have the ability to run a single-node VictoriaLogs on a host with more CPU / RAM / storage space / storage IO,
then it is preferred to do this instead of switching to cluster mode, since a single-node VictoriaLogs instance has the following advantages over cluster mode:

- It is easier to configure, manage and troubleshoot, since it consists of a single self-contained component.
- It provides better performance and capacity on the same hardware, since it doesn't need
  to transfer data over the network between cluster components.

The migration path from a single-node VictoriaLogs to cluster mode is very easy - just add its' TCP address to the list of `vlstorage` nodes
passed via `-storageNode` command-line flag to `vlinsert` and `vlselect` components of the cluster mode.
See [cluster architecture](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture) for more details about VictoriaLogs cluster components.

See [quick start guide](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#quick-start) on how to start working with VictoriaLogs cluster.

## Architecture

VictoriaLogs in cluster mode is composed of three main components: `vlinsert`, `vlselect`, and `vlstorage`.

- `vlinsert` accepts logs via [all supported protocols](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/).
  It distributes (shards) incoming logs evenly across the `vlstorage` nodes specified in the `-storageNode` command-line flag.

- `vlselect` accepts queries via [all supported query endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/).
  It executes the incoming queries in parallel across the `vlstorage` nodes specified in the `-storageNode` command-line flag,
  merges query results received from the `vlstorage` nodes and returns the response to the client.

- `vlstorage` performs two key roles:
  - It stores logs received from `vlinsert` at the directory defined by the `-storageDataPath` flag.
    See [storage configuration docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#storage) for details.
  - It executes queries received from `vlselect` and returns the query results to `vlselect` for further processing.

All the cluster components - `vlinsert`, `vlselect` and `vlstorage` - share the same executable - single-node VictoriaLogs.
The executable converts to `vlinsert` and `vlselect` node if a comma-separated list of TCP addresses of `vlstorage` nodes is passed to the `-storageNode` command-line flag.
For example, the following command starts a node, which serves both `vlinsert` and `vlselect` requests and forwards them to `vlstorage-1:9428` and `vlstorage-2:9428` nodes:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=vlstorage-1:9428,vlstorage-2:9428
```

If you want disabling the access to [insert APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-apis), i.e. to run as a `vlselect` node only,
then pass `-insert.disable` command-line flag:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=... -insert.disable
```

If you want disabling the access to [select APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api), i.e. to run as a `vlinsert` node only,
then pass `-select.disable` command-line flag:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=... -select.disable
```

It is recommended to run separate sets of `vlinsert` and `vlselect` nodes, so data ingestion workload doesn't affect querying workload and vice versa.

If the `-storageNode` command-line flag isn't passed to single-node VictoriaLogs, then it runs as a `vlstorage`, i.e. it accepts data from `vlinsert` nodes
and accepts queries from `vlselect` nodes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#single-node-and-cluster-mode-duality) for details.

All the VictoriaLogs cluster components are horizontally scalable and can be deployed on hardware best suited for their respective workloads.

Communication between `vlinsert` / `vlselect` and `vlstorage` is done via HTTP over the port specified by the `-httpListenAddr` flag (`9428` by default):

- `vlinsert` sends data to the `/internal/insert` HTTP endpoint at `vlstorage`.
- `vlselect` sends queries to `/internal/select/*` HTTP endponts at `vlstorage`.

This HTTP-based communication model allows using reverse proxies for authorization, routing, and encryption between components.

For advanced setups, refer to the [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#multi-level-cluster-setup) documentation.

## High availability

VictoriaLogs cluster provides high availability for [data ingestion path](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/).
It continues accepting incoming logs when some of the `vlstorage` nodes are temporarily unavailable.
`vlinsert` evenly spreads new logs among the remaining available `vlstorage` nodes in this case, so newly ingested logs are properly stored and are available for querying
without any delays. This allows performing maintenance tasks for `vlstorage` nodes (such as upgrades, configuration updates, etc.) without worrying about data loss.
Make sure that the remaining `vlstorage` nodes have enough capacity for the increased data ingestion workload, in order to avoid availability problems.

VictoriaLogs cluster returns `502 Bad Gateway` errors for [incoming queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/)
if some of the `vlstorage` nodes are unavailable or expose an internal API version incompatible with `vlselect`. This guarantees consistent query responses
(e.g. all the stored logs are taken into account during the query) during maintenance tasks at `vlstorage` nodes. Note that all the newly incoming logs are properly stored
to the remaining `vlstorage` nodes - see the paragraph above, so they become available for querying immediately after all the `vlstorage` nodes return back to the cluster.

A version mismatch usually happens during a rolling upgrade, when some `vlstorage` nodes are upgraded while others aren't.
The [release notes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/changelog/) list such incompatibilities, so check them before upgrading.
The errors stop after all the components are upgraded to compatible versions.

There are practical cases when it is preferred to return partial responses instead of `502 Bad Gateway` errors if some of `vlstorage` nodes are unavailable.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#partial-responses) on how to achieve this.

> [!NOTE] Insight
> In most real-world cases, `vlstorage` nodes become unavailable during planned maintenance such as upgrades, config changes, or rolling restarts.
> These are typically infrequent (weekly or monthly) and brief (a few minutes) events.
> <br>
> <br>
> A short period of query downtime during maintenance tasks is acceptable and fits well within most SLAs. For example, 43 minutes of downtime per month during maintenance tasks
> provides ~99.9% cluster availability. This is better in practice compared to "magic" HA schemes with opaque auto-recovery - if these schemes fail,
> then it is impossible to debug and fix them in a timely manner, so this will likely result in a long outage, which violates SLAs.

The real HA scheme for both data ingestion and querying can be built only when copies of logs are sent into independent VictoriaLogs instances (or clusters)
located in fully independent availability zones (datacenters).

If an AZ becomes unavailable, then new logs continue to be written to the remaining AZ,
while queries return full responses from the remaining AZ. When the AZ becomes available, then the pending buffered logs can be written to it, so the AZ
can be used for querying full responses. This HA scheme can be built with the help of [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/)
for data replication and buffering, and [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) for data querying:

![cluster-ha.webp](cluster-ha.webp)
{width="600"}

- [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/) receives and replicates logs to two VictoriaLogs clusters.
  If one cluster becomes unavailable, then the `vlagent` continues sending logs to the remaining healthy cluster. It also buffers logs that cannot be delivered to the unavailable cluster.
  When the failed cluster becomes available again, the `vlagent` sends the buffered logs to it. After all the buffered logs are sent to the returned cluster, it can start serving queries.
  This is usually done manually by starting `vlselect` nodes in the cluster.
- [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) routes query requests to healthy VictoriaLogs clusters.
  If one cluster becomes unavailable, `vmauth` detects this and automatically redirects all query traffic to the remaining healthy cluster.

There is no magic coordination logic or consensus algorithms in this scheme. This simplifies managing and troubleshooting this HA scheme.

See also [replication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#replication).

## Replication

`vlinsert` doesn't replicate incoming logs among `vlstorage` nodes in [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture).
Instead, it spreads evenly (shards) incoming logs among `vlstorage` nodes specified in the `-storageNode` command-line flag.
This provides cost-efficient linear scalability for the cluster capacity, data ingestion performance and querying performance proportional to the number of `vlstorage` nodes.

It is recommended making regular backups for the data stored across all the `vlstorage` nodes in order to make sure that the data isn't lost in case of any disaster
(such as accidental data removal because of incorrect config updates or incorrect upgrades, or physical corruption of the data on the persistent storage).
See [how to backup and restore data for VictoriaLogs - these docs apply to vlstorage nodes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#backup-and-restore).

If you need restoring the data between the backup time and the current time, then it is recommended building
[HA setup for VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#high-availability),
so you could copy the needed per-day partitions from cluster replica.

Usually the disaster event occurs rarely (e.g. once per year). Every such event has unique preconditions and consequences,
so it is impossible to automate recovering from disaster events. These events require human attention and carefully thought manual actions,
so there is little practical sense in relying on automatic data recovery from the magically replicated data among storage nodes.

## Single-node and cluster mode duality

A single-node VictoriaLogs instance can be used as `vlstorage` node in [VictoriaLogs cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture):

- It accepts data ingestion requests from `vlinsert` via `/internal/insert` HTTP endpoint at the TCP port specified via `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.
  This endpoint can be disabled via `-internalinsert.disable` command-line flag. See [security docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#security) for details.
- It accepts queries from `vlselect` via `/internal/select/*` HTTP endpoints at the TCP port specified via `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.
  These endpoints can be disabled via `-internalselect.disable` command-line flag. See [security docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#security) for details.

Every `vlstorage` node can be used as a single-node VictoriaLogs instance:

- It can accept logs via [all the supported data ingestion protocols](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/).
- It can accept `select` queries via [all the supported HTTP querying endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/).

## Multi-level cluster setup

- `vlinsert` can send the ingested logs to other `vlinsert` nodes if they are specified via `-storageNode` command-line flag.
  This allows building multi-level data ingestion schemes when top-level `vlinsert` spreads the incoming logs evenly among multiple lower-level clusters of VictoriaLogs.
  If you don't want accepting logs from other `vlinsert` nodes, then run the `vlinsert` node with `-internalinsert.disable` command-line flag.
  See [security docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#security) for details.

- `vlselect` can send queries to other `vlselect` nodes if they are specified via `-storageNode` command-line flag.
  This allows building multi-level cluster schemes when top-level `vlselect` queries multiple lower-level clusters of VictoriaLogs.
  If you don't want accepting queries from other `vlselect` nodes, then the `vlselect` node with `-internalselect.disable` command-line flag.

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#tls) on how to protect communications between
multiple levels of `vlinsert` and `vlselect` nodes.

## Security

All the [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture) components must run in a protected internal network
without direct access from the Internet. HTTP authorization proxies such as [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/)
must be used in front of `vlinsert` and `vlselect` for authorizing access to these components from the Internet.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/) for details.

It is possible to disallow access to `/internal/insert` endpoint and `/internal/select/*` endpoints by running VictoriaLogs with `-internalinsert.disable`
and `-internalselect.disable` command-line flags.

It is possible to disallow access to [HTTP insert APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-apis) via `-insert.disable` command-line flag.
This flag also disables access to `/internal/insert/*` endpoints.

It is possible to disally access to [HTTP query APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) via `-select.disable` command-line flag.
This flag also disables access to `/internal/select/*` endpoints.

By default, all the VictoriaLogs cluster components (`vlinsert`, `vlselect`, `vlstorage`) support all the HTTP endpoints including `/insert/*` and `/select/*`.
It is recommended disabling select endpoints on dedicated `vlinsert` nodes and insert endpoints on dedicated `vlselect` nodes:

```sh
# Disable select endpoints on vlinsert
./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=... -select.disable

# Disable insert endpoints on vlselect
./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=... -insert.disable
```

This prevents processing select requests at `vlinsert` nodes or insert requests at `vlselect` nodes in case of a misconfiguration in the authorization proxy
in front of the `vlinsert` and `vlselect` nodes.

### TLS

By default, `vlinsert` and `vlselect` communicate with `vlstorage` via unencrypted HTTP. This is OK if all these components are located
in the same protected internal network according to [the security recommendations](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#security).
If they communicate over untrusted networks (for example, in [multi-level setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#multi-level-cluster-setup)),
then it is recommended to switch to HTTPS:

- Specify `-tls`, `-tlsCertFile` and `-tlsKeyFile` command-line flags at `vlstorage`, so it accepts incoming requests
  over HTTPS instead of HTTP at the corresponding `-httpListenAddr`:

  ```sh
  ./victoria-logs-prod -httpListenAddr=... -storageDataPath=... -tls -tlsCertFile=/path/to/certfile -tlsKeyFile=/path/to/keyfile
  ```

- Specify `-storageNode.tls` command-line flag at `vlinsert` and `vlselect`, which communicate with the `vlstorage` over untrusted networks such as the Internet:

  ```sh
  ./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=... -storageNode.tls
  ```

It is also recommended to authorize HTTPS requests to `vlstorage` via Basic Auth:

- Specify `-httpAuth.username` and `-httpAuth.password` command-line flags at `vlstorage`, so it verifies the Basic Auth username + password
  in HTTPS requests received via `-httpListenAddr`:

  ```sh
  ./victoria-logs-prod -httpListenAddr=... -storageDataPath=... -tls -tlsCertFile=... -tlsKeyFile=... -httpAuth.username=... -httpAuth.password=...
  ```

- Specify `-storageNode.username` and `-storageNode.password` command-line flags at `vlinsert` and `vlselect`, which communicate with the `vlstorage` over untrusted networks:

  ```sh
  ./victoria-logs-prod -storageNode=... -storageNode.tls -storageNode.username=... -storageNode.password=...
  ```

See also [how to set up mTLS between VictoriaLogs cluster nodes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#mtls).

### mTLS

[Enterprise version of VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) supports the ability to verify client TLS certificates
at the `vlstorage` side for TLS connections established from `vlinsert` and `vlselect` nodes (aka [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication#mTLS)).
See [TLS docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#tls) for details on how to set up TLS communications between VictoriaLogs cluster nodes.

mTLS authentication can be enabled by passing the `-mtls` command-line flag to the `vlstorage` node in addition to the `-tls` command-line flag.
In this case it verifies TLS client certificates for connections from `vlinsert` and `vlselect` at the address specified via `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.

The client TLS certificate must be specified at `vlinsert` and `vlselect` nodes via `-storageNode.tlsCertFile` and `-storageNode.tlsKeyFile` command-line flags.

By default, the system-wide [root CA certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate) are used for verifying client TLS certificates.
The `-mtlsCAFile` command-line flag can be used at `vlstorage` for pointing to custom root CA certificates.

## Rebalancing

Every `vlinsert` node spreads evenly (shards) incoming logs among `vlstorage` nodes specified in the `-storageNode` command-line flag
according to the [VictoriaLogs cluster architecture](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture).
When new `vlstorage` nodes are added to the `-storageNode` list at `vlinsert`, then all the newly ingested logs are spread evenly
among old and new `vlstorage` nodes, while historical data remains on the old `vlstorage` nodes. This improves data ingestion performance
and querying performance for typical production workloads, since newly ingested logs are spread evenly across all the `vlstorage` nodes,
while typical queries are performed over the newly ingested logs, which are already present among all the `vlstorage` nodes.
This also provides the following benefits comparing to the scheme with automatic data rebalancing:

- Cluster performance remains reliable just after adding new `vlstorage` nodes, since network bandwidth, disk IO and CPU resources
  aren't spent on automatic data rebalancing, which may take days for re-balancing of petabytes of data.
- This eliminates the whole class of hard-to-troubleshoot and resolve issues, which may happen with the cluster during automatic data rebalancing.
  For example, what happens if some of `vlstorage` nodes become unavailable during the re-balancing? Or what happens if new `vlstorage` nodes
  are added while the previous data re-balancing isn't finished yet?
- This allows building flexible cluster schemes where distinct subsets of `vlinsert` nodes spread incoming logs among different subsets of `vlstorage`
  nodes with different configs and different hardware resources.

The following approaches exist for manual data re-balancing among old and new `vlstorage` nodes if it is really needed:

- To wait until historical data is automatically deleted from old `vlstorage` nodes according to the configured [retention](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#retention).
  Then old and new `vlstorage` nodes will have equal amounts of data.
- To configure `vlinsert` to write newly ingested logs only to new `vlstorage` nodes, while `vlselect` nodes should continue querying data from all the `vlstorage` nodes.
  Then wait until the data size on the new `vlstorage` nodes becomes equal to the data size on the old `vlstorage` nodes, and return back old `vlstorage` nodes
  to `-storageNode` list at `vlinsert`.
- To manually move historical per-day partitions from old `vlstorage` nodes to new `vlstorage` nodes. VictoriaLogs provides the functionality, which simplifies
  doing this work without the need to stop or restart `vlstorage` nodes - see [partitions lifecycle docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle).

## Quick start

The following topics are covered below:

- How to download the VictoriaLogs executable.
- How to start a VictoriaLogs cluster, which consists of two `vlstorage` nodes, a single `vlinsert` node and a single `vlselect` node
  running on localhost according to [cluster architecture](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture).
- How to ingest logs into the cluster.
- How to query the ingested logs.

If you want running VictoriaLogs cluster in Kubernetes, then please read [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-cluster/).

Download and unpack the latest VictoriaLogs release:

```sh
curl -L -O https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/download/v1.51.0/victoria-logs-linux-amd64-v1.51.0.tar.gz
tar xzf victoria-logs-linux-amd64-v1.51.0.tar.gz
```

Start the first [`vlstorage` node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture), which accepts incoming requests at the port `9491`
and stores the ingested logs in the `victoria-logs-data-1` directory:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -httpListenAddr=:9491 -storageDataPath=victoria-logs-data-1 &
```

This command and all the following commands start cluster components as background processes.
Use `jobs`, `fg`, `bg` commands for manipulating the running background processes. Use the `kill` command and/or `Ctrl+C` to stop running processes when they are no longer needed.
See [these docs](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x9644.html) for details.

Start the second `vlstorage` node, which accepts incoming requests at the port `9492` and stores the ingested logs in the `victoria-logs-data-2` directory:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -httpListenAddr=:9492 -storageDataPath=victoria-logs-data-2 &
```

Start the `vlinsert` node, which accepts logs via [all the supported data ingestion APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) at the port `9481` and spreads
them evenly across the two `vlstorage` nodes started above. The `-select.disable` command-line flag disables accepting select queries at the started `vlinsert` node:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -httpListenAddr=:9481 -storageNode=localhost:9491,localhost:9492 -select.disable &
```

Start the `vlselect` node, which serves [HTTP querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/) at the port `9471` and requests the needed data
from `vlstorage` nodes started above. The `-insert.disable` command-line flag disables acceping insert requests at the started `vlselect` node:

```sh
./victoria-logs-prod -httpListenAddr=:9471 -storageNode=localhost:9491,localhost:9492 -insert.disable &
```

Note that all the VictoriaLogs cluster components - `vlstorage`, `vlinsert` and `vlselect` - share the same executable - `victoria-logs-prod`.
Their roles depend on whether the `-storageNode` command-line flag is set - if this flag is set, then the executable runs in `vlinsert` and `vlselect` modes.
Otherwise, it runs in `vlstorage` mode, which is identical to a [single-node VictoriaLogs mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/).

Let's ingest some logs (aka [wide events](https://jeremymorrell.dev/blog/a-practitioners-guide-to-wide-events/))
from [GitHub archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) into the VictoriaLogs cluster with the following command:

```sh
curl -s https://data.gharchive.org/$(date -d '2 days ago' '+%Y-%m-%d')-10.json.gz \
        | curl -T - -X POST -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' 'http://localhost:9481/insert/jsonline?_time_field=created_at&_stream_fields=type'
```

This command downloads a hour of wide events from GitHub archive and ingests them into VictoriaLogs
via [JSON line endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api).

Let's query the ingested logs via [`/select/logsql/query` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs).
For example, the following command returns the number of stored logs in the cluster:

```sh
curl http://localhost:9471/select/logsql/query -d 'query=* | count()'
```

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#command-line) for details on how to query logs from the command line.

Logs can also be explored and queried via the [built-in Web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui).
Open `http://localhost:9471/select/vmui/` in the web browser, select `last 7 days` time range in the top right corner and explore the ingested logs.
See [LogsQL docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) to familiarize yourself with the query language.

Every `vlstorage` node can be queried individually because [it is equivalent to a single-node VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#single-node-and-cluster-mode-duality).
For example, the following command returns the number of stored logs at the first `vlstorage` node started above:

```sh
curl http://localhost:9491/select/logsql/query -d 'query=* | count()'
```

We recommend reading [key concepts](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/) before you start working with VictoriaLogs.

See also [security docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#security).

## Capacity planning

It is recommended leaving the following amounts of spare resource across all the components of [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture):

- 50% of free RAM for reducing the probability of OOM (out of memory) crashes and slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
- 50% of spare CPU for reducing the probability of slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
- At least 20% of free storage space at `vlstorage` nodes at the directory pointed by the [`-storageDataPath`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#storage) command-line flag.
  Too small amounts of free disk space may result in significant slowdown for both data ingestion and querying
  because of inability to merge newly created smaller data parts into bigger data parts.

## Performance tuning

Cluster components of VictoriaLogs automatically adjust their settings for the best performance and the lowest resource usage on the given hardware.
So there is no need for any tuning of these components in general. The following options can be used for achieving higher performance / lower resource
usage on systems with constrained resources:

- `vlinsert` limits the number of concurrent requests to every `vlstorage` node. The default concurrency works great in most cases.
  Sometimes it is worth increasing the data ingestion concurrency via `-insert.concurrency` command-line flag at `vlinsert` in order
  to achieve higher data ingestion rate at the cost of higher RAM usage at `vlinsert` and `vlstorage` nodes.

- `vlinsert` compresses the data sent to `vlstorage` nodes in order to reduce network bandwidth usage at the cost of slightly higher CPU usage
  at `vlinsert` and `vlstorage` nodes. The compression can be disabled by passing `-insert.disableCompression` command-line flag to `vlinsert`.
  This reduces CPU usage at `vlinsert` and `vlstorage` nodes at the cost of significantly higher network bandwidth usage.

- `vlselect` requests compressed data from `vlstorage` nodes in order to reduce network bandwidth usage at the cost of slightly higher CPU usage
  at `vlselect` and `vlstorage` nodes. The compression can be disabled by passing `-select.disableCompression` command-line flag to `vlselect`.
  This reduces CPU usage at `vlselect` and `vlstorage` nodes at the cost of significantly higher network bandwidth usage.

## Advanced usage

[Cluster components of VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture) provide various settings, which can be configured via command-line flags if needed.
Default values for all the command-line flags work great in most cases, so it isn't recommended
tuning them without the real need. See [the list of supported command-line flags at VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
