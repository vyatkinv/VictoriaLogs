[vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) integrates with VictoriaLogs via stats APIs [`/select/logsql/stats_query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats)
and [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats).
These endpoints return log stats in a format compatible with the [Prometheus querying API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#instant-queries).
This allows using VictoriaLogs as the datasource in vmalert and creating alerting and recording rules via [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/).
VictoriaLogs also can proxy `/select/vmalert/*` requests to `vmalert` according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#vmalert).

> This page provides only integration instructions for vmalert and VictoriaLogs. See the full textbook for vmalert [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/).

## Quick Start

Run vmalert with the following settings:

```sh
./bin/vmalert -rule=alert.rules                  \  # Path to the files or HTTP URL with alerting and/or recording rules in YAML format
    -datasource.url=http://victorialogs:9428     \  # VictoriaLogs address
    -notifier.url=http://alertmanager:9093       \  # Alertmanager URL (required if alerting rules are used)
    -remoteWrite.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \  # Remote write-compatible storage to persist recording rules and alerts state info
    -remoteRead.url=http://victoriametrics:8428  \  # Prometheus HTTP API-compatible datasource to restore alerts state from
```

> Note: By default, vmalert assumes all configured rules have the `prometheus` type and will validate them accordingly.
> For rules in [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/), specify `type: vlogs` at the [group level](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#groups).
> Or set the `-rule.defaultRuleType=vlogs` command-line flag to change the default rule type.

Each `-rule` file may contain an arbitrary number of [groups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#groups).
See examples in the [Groups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#groups) section. See the full list of configuration flags and their descriptions in the [Configuration](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#configuration) section.

With the configuration example above, vmalert will perform the following interactions:
![vmalert](vmalert_victorialogs.webp)

1. Rules listed in the `-rule` file are executed against the VictoriaLogs service configured via `-datasource.url`.
2. Triggered alerting notifications are sent to the [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) service configured via `-notifier.url`.
3. Results of recording rule expressions and alerts state are persisted to a Prometheus-compatible remote-write endpoint
   (i.e., VictoriaMetrics) configured via `-remoteWrite.url`.
4. On vmalert restarts, alerts state [can be restored](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#alerts-state-on-restarts)
   by querying a Prometheus-compatible HTTP API endpoint (i.e., VictoriaMetrics) configured via `-remoteRead.url`.

## Configuration

### Flags

For a complete list of command-line flags, visit [https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#flags](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#flags) or execute the `./vmalert --help` command.
The following are key flags related to integration with VictoriaLogs:

```shellhelp
-datasource.url string
   Datasource address supporting log stats APIs, which can be a single VictoriaLogs node or a proxy in front of VictoriaLogs. Supports an address in the form of an IP address with a port (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8428) or a DNS SRV record.
-notifier.url array
   Prometheus Alertmanager URL, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:9093. List all Alertmanager URLs if it runs in cluster mode to ensure high availability.
   Supports an array of values separated by commas or specified via multiple flags.
   Values can contain commas inside a single-quoted or double-quoted string, and inside {}, [] and () braces.
-remoteWrite.url string
   Optional URL to VictoriaMetrics or vminsert where to persist alerts state and recording rule results as time series. Supports an address in the form of an IP address with a port (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8428) or a DNS SRV record. For example, if -remoteWrite.url=http://127.0.0.1:8428 is specified, then the alerts state will be written to http://127.0.0.1:8428/api/v1/write. See also '-remoteWrite.disablePathAppend', '-remoteWrite.showURL'.
-remoteRead.url string
   Optional URL to a datasource compatible with MetricsQL. It can be a single-node VictoriaMetrics or vmselect. Remote read is used to restore alerts state. This configuration makes sense only if vmalert was configured with '-remoteWrite.url' before and has successfully persisted its state. Supports an address in the form of an IP address with a port (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8428) or a DNS SRV record. See also '-remoteRead.disablePathAppend', '-remoteRead.showURL'.
-rule array
   Path to the files or HTTP URL with alerting and/or recording rules in YAML format.
   Supports hierarchical patterns and regular expressions.
   Examples:
    -rule="/path/to/file". Path to a single file with alerting rules.
    -rule="http://<some-server-addr>/path/to/rules". HTTP URL to a page with alerting rules.
    -rule="dir/*.yaml" -rule="/*.yaml" -rule="gcs://vmalert-rules/tenant_%{TENANT_ID}/prod".
    -rule="dir/**/*.yaml". Includes all the .yaml files in "dir" subfolders recursively.
   Rule files support multi-document YAML. Files may contain %{ENV_VAR} placeholders, which are substituted by the corresponding env vars.
   The enterprise version of vmalert supports S3 and GCS paths to rules.
   For example: gs://bucket/path/to/rules, s3://bucket/path/to/rules
   S3 and GCS paths support only matching by prefix, e.g. s3://bucket/dir/rule_ matches
   all files with prefix rule_ in folder dir.
   Supports an array of values separated by commas or specified via multiple flags.
   Values can contain commas inside a single-quoted or double-quoted string, and inside {}, [] and () braces.
-rule.defaultRuleType
   The default type for rule expressions; can be overridden by the 'type' parameter inside the rule group. Supported values: "graphite", "prometheus" and "vlogs".
   The default is "prometheus"; change it to "vlogs" if all rules are written with LogsQL.
-rule.evalDelay time
   Adjustment of the time parameter for rule evaluation requests to compensate for intentional data delay from the datasource. Normally, it should be equal to `-search.latencyOffset` (command-line flag configured for VictoriaMetrics single-node or vmselect).
   Since there is no intentional search delay in VictoriaLogs, `-rule.evalDelay` can be reduced to a few seconds to accommodate network and ingestion time.
```

See the full list of configuration options [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#configuration).

### Groups

See the complete group attributes [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#groups).

#### Alerting rules

`vmalert` executes the given [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) from the `expr` option
according to the provided `interval`. See [config options for alerting rules](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#alerting-rules)
for more details.

The `expr` query must contain [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) in order to calculate
some metric over the selected logs, and use this metric in alerting threshold. Use [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe)
for filtering the calculated metric according to the needed threshold. For example, the following alerting rule fires if the number of `error` or `warn` logs on a single pod in `env=prod` exceeds 10 during the last 5 minutes:

```yaml
groups:
- name: ServiceLog
  type: vlogs
  interval: 5m
  rules:
  - alert: HasMoreThan10ErrorLogs
    expr: '{env=prod} status:in(error,warn) | stats by (k8s.pod.name) count() as error_logs | filter error_logs:>10'
    annotations:
      description: 'Too big number of errors and warnings on pod {{ index .Labels "k8s.pod.name" }} during the last 5 minutes: {{$value}}'
```

It is possible to group the calculated metrics by arbitrary log fields, by using [`stats by (...)` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-fields).

Use [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe)
for performing additional calculations over the metrics calculated with [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe).

Use [`fields` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#fields-pipe) for leaving only the needed metrics.

The following example of alerting rule uses `stats by (...)`, `math` and `fields` pipes
for triggering an alert if the number of failed requests exceeds 10% for the given `ip`:


```yaml
- name: ServiceRequest
  type: vlogs
  interval: 5m
  rules:
  - alert: TooManyFailedRequestsByIP
    expr: '* | extract "ip=<ip> " | extract "status_code=<code>;" | stats by (ip) count() if (code:~"4.*") as failed, count() as total | math (failed / total) * 100 as failed_percentage | filter failed_percentage:>10 | fields ip, failed_percentage'
    annotations:
      description: "Connection from address {{$labels.ip}} has {{$value}}% failed requests in the last 5 minutes"
```

#### Recording rules

`vmalert` executes the given [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) from the `expr` option
according to the provided `interval` and stores the query results as metrics at the remote storage specified via `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flag.
See [config options for recording rules](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#recording-rules)
for more details.

The `expr` query must contain [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) in order to calculate
some metric over the selected logs. For example, the following recording rule calculates the number of logs for `env=test` and `service=nginx`
per every 5 minute `interval`:

```yaml
groups:
- name: RequestCount
  type: vlogs
  interval: 5m
  rules:
  - record: nginxRequestCount
    expr: '{env=test,service=nginx} | stats count(*) as requests'
```

It is possible to group the calculated metrics by arbitrary log fields, by using [`stats by (...)` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-fields).

Use [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe)
for performing additional calculations over the metrics calculated with [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe).

Use [`fields` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#fields-pipe) for leaving only the needed metrics.

The following example of recording rule uses `stats by (...)`, `math` and `fields` pipes
for calculating the share of errors per each `service` per every 5 minute `interval`:

```yaml
groups:
- name: RequestCount
  type: vlogs
  interval: 5m
  rules:
  - record: prodErrorsShareByService
    expr: '{env=prod} | stats by (service) count() as logs_total, count() if (error) errors | math (errors / total) as errors_share | fields service, errors_share'
```

## Time filter

It's recommended to omit the [time filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) in rule expressions.
By default, vmalert automatically appends the time filter `_time: <group_interval>` to the expression.
For instance, the rule below will be evaluated every 5 minutes and will return the result with logs from the last 5 minutes:

```yaml
groups:
- name: Requests
  type: vlogs
  interval: 5m
  rules:
  - alert: TooManyFailedRequestByIP
    expr: '* | extract "ip=<ip> " | extract "status_code=<code>;" | stats by (ip) count() if (code:~"4.*") as failed, count() as total | math (failed / total) * 100 as failed_percentage | filter failed_percentage:>10 | fields ip, failed_percentage'
    annotations:
      description: "Connection from address {{$labels.ip}} has {{$value}}% failed requests in the last 5 minutes"
```

Users can specify a custom time filter if needed. For example, the rule below will be evaluated every 5 minutes
but will calculate the result over the logs from the last 10 minutes.

```yaml
groups:
- name: Requests
  type: vlogs
  interval: 5m
  rules:
  - alert: TooManyFailedRequestByIP
    expr: '_time:10m | extract "ip=<ip> " | extract "status_code=<code>;" | stats by (ip) count() if (code:~"4.*") as failed, count() as total | math (failed / total) * 100 as failed_percentage | filter failed_percentage:>10 | fields ip, failed_percentage'
    annotations:
    description: "Connection from address {{$labels.ip}} has {{$value}}% failed requests in the last 10 minutes"
```

_Please note, vmalert doesn't support [backfilling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#rules-backfilling) for rules with a customized time filter yet (might be added in the future)._

## Rules backfilling

vmalert supports alerting and recording rule backfilling (aka replay) against VictoriaLogs as the datasource.

```sh
./bin/vmalert -rule=path/to/your.rules \        # path to files with rules you usually use with vmalert
    -datasource.url=http://localhost:9428 \     # VictoriaLogs address
    -rule.defaultRuleType=vlogs \               # Set default rule type to VictoriaLogs
    -remoteWrite.url=http://localhost:8428 \    # Remote write-compatible storage to persist rules and alerts state info
    -replay.timeFrom=2021-05-11T07:21:43Z \     # start replay from
    -replay.timeTo=2021-05-29T18:40:43Z         # finish replay at (optional; defaults to current time)
```

See more details about backfilling [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#rules-backfilling).

## Performance tip

LogsQL allows users to obtain multiple stats from a single expression. For instance, the following query calculates
the 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles for the `request_duration_seconds` field over logs for the last 5 minutes:

```logsql
_time:5m | stats
  quantile(0.5, request_duration_seconds) p50,
  quantile(0.9, request_duration_seconds) p90,
  quantile(0.99, request_duration_seconds) p99
```

This expression can also be used in recording rules as follows:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: requestDuration
    type: vlogs
    interval: 5m
    rules:
      - record: requestDurationQuantile
        expr: '* | stats by (service) quantile(0.5, request_duration_seconds) p50, quantile(0.9, request_duration_seconds) p90, quantile(0.99, request_duration_seconds) p99'
```

This rule generates three metrics per service in each evaluation:

```
requestDurationQuantile{stats_result="p50", service="service-1"}
requestDurationQuantile{stats_result="p90", service="service-1"}
requestDurationQuantile{stats_result="p99", service="service-1"}

requestDurationQuantile{stats_result="p50", service="service-2"}
requestDurationQuantile{stats_result="p90", service="service-2"}
requestDurationQuantile{stats_result="p99", service="service-2"}
...
```

For additional tips on writing LogsQL, refer to this [doc](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#performance-tips).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to attach a sample log row to alerts?

Sometimes it may be useful to attach a representative log line to the alert message (e.g. for Slack notifications without opening UI).
Use [`row_any()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_any-stats) only inside `annotations` via the `query` template function.

> Note: do not use these functions in `expr`, since the returned row can change between evaluations. vmalert identifies each alert instance by the full label set (excluding `__name__`), changing labels leads to alert flapping and resets the `for:` timer.

Example with a stable `expr` and a sampled log message in `annotations`:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: vlogs
    type: vlogs
    interval: 1m
    rules:
      - alert: ErrorsByPath
        expr: '* | stats by (path) count() as errors | filter errors:>10'
        for: 2m
        annotations:
          description: >-
            path={{ $labels.path }} errors={{ $value }}
            {{ $ms := query (printf "path:%q | stats count() as hits, row_any(_msg) as sample_msg | filter hits:>0" $labels.path) }}
            {{ if gt (len $ms) 0 }}sample={{ label "sample_msg" (index $ms 0) }}{{ end }}
```

The same approach applies to [`row_max()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_max-stats) and [`row_min()`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_min-stats).
For example, use `row_max(duration, _msg)` in an annotation query if you want to attach the "slowest" log line in the evaluation window (the log entry with the maximum `duration`), and use `row_min(duration, _msg)` if you want to attach the "fastest" one (minimum `duration`).

### How to use [multitenancy](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy) in rules?

vmalert doesn't support multi-tenancy for VictoriaLogs in the same way as it [supports it for VictoriaMetrics in the Enterprise version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#multitenancy).
However, it is possible to specify the tenant to query in the VictoriaLogs datasource via the `headers` parameter in the [group config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#groups).
For example, the following config will execute all the rules within the group against the tenant with `AccountID=1` and `ProjectID=2`:

```yaml
    groups:
    - name: MyGroup
      headers:
      - "AccountID: 1"
      - "ProjectID: 2"
      rules: ...
```

By default, vmalert persists all results to the specific tenant in VictoriaMetrics that is specified by `-remoteWrite.url`. For example, if `-remoteWrite.url=http://vminsert:8480/insert/0/prometheus/` is set, all data goes to tenant `0`.
To persist different rule results to different tenants in VictoriaMetrics, there are the following approaches:

1. Use the [multitenant endpoint of vminsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy-via-labels) as the `-remoteWrite.url`, and add tenant labels under the group configuration.

    For example, run vmalert with:

    ```
    ./bin/vmalert -datasource.url=http://localhost:9428 -remoteWrite.url=http://vminsert:8480/insert/multitenant/prometheus ...
    ```

    With the rules below, `recordingTenant123` will be queried from VictoriaLogs tenant `123` and persisted to tenant `123` in VictoriaMetrics, while `recordingTenant123-456:789` will be queried from VictoriaLogs tenant `124` and persisted to tenant `456:789` in VictoriaMetrics.

    ```
    groups:
      - name: recordingTenant123
        type: vlogs
        headers:
          - "AccountID: 123"
        labels:
          vm_account_id: 123
        rules:
          - record: recordingTenant123
            expr: 'tags.path:/var/log/httpd OR tags.path:/var/log/nginx | stats by (tags.host) count() requests'
      - name: recordingTenant124-456:789
        type: vlogs
        headers:
          - "AccountID: 124"
        labels:
          vm_account_id: 456
          vm_project_id: 789
        rules:
        - record: recordingTenant124-456:789
            expr: 'tags.path:/var/log/httpd OR tags.path:/var/log/nginx | stats by (tags.host) count() requests'
    ```

2. Run the [enterprise version of vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) with `-clusterMode` enabled, and specify the tenant parameter for each group.

    For example, run vmalert with:

    ```
    ./bin/vmalert -datasource.url=http://localhost:9428 -clusterMode=true -remoteWrite.url=http://vminsert:8480/ ...
    ```

    With the rules below, `recordingTenant123` will be queried from VictoriaLogs tenant `123` and persisted to tenant `123` in VictoriaMetrics, while `recordingTenant123-456:789` will be queried from VictoriaLogs tenant `124` and persisted to tenant `456:789` in VictoriaMetrics.

    ```
    groups:
      - name: recordingTenant123
        type: vlogs
        headers:
          - "AccountID: 123"
        tenant: "123"
        rules:
          - record: recordingTenant123
            expr: 'tags.path:/var/log/httpd OR tags.path:/var/log/nginx | stats by (tags.host) count() requests'
      - name: recordingTenant124-456:789
        type: vlogs
        headers:
          - "AccountID: 124"
        tenant: "456:789"
        rules:
        - record: recordingTenant124-456:789
            expr: 'tags.path:/var/log/httpd OR tags.path:/var/log/nginx | stats by (tags.host) count() requests'
    ```

### How to use one vmalert for VictoriaLogs and VictoriaMetrics rules at the same time?

We recommend running separate instances of vmalert for VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs.
However, vmalert supports having many groups with different rule types (`vlogs`, `prometheus`, `graphite`).
Only one `-datasource.url` command-line flag can be specified, so it can't be configured with more than one datasource.
VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs datasources have different query path prefixes, so it is possible to use
[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) to route requests of different types between datasources.
See an example of a vmauth config for such routing below:

vmalert should be configured with `-datasource.url=http://vmauth:8427/`, so all datasource requests go through vmauth.
vmauth routes these requests to VictoriaMetrics or VictoriaLogs according to the request path, as shown in the examples below.

#### Using VictoriaMetrics Single Node

```yaml
    unauthorized_user:
      url_map:
        - src_paths:
          - "/api/v1/query.*"
          url_prefix: "http://victoriametrics:8428"
        - src_paths:
          - "/select/logsql/.*"
          url_prefix: "http://victorialogs:9428"
```

#### Using VictoriaMetrics Cluster
For VictoriaMetrics cluster, Prometheus requests must be routed to a tenant-specific `vmselect` path, because OSS vmalert doesn't add VictoriaMetrics tenant IDs to the datasource URL automatically.

VictoriaLogs requests can keep the same route, because VictoriaLogs tenant IDs are passed via `AccountID` and `ProjectID` HTTP headers instead of URL path segments.
Please refer to [How to use multitenancy in rules](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#how-to-use-multitenancy-in-rules) for information on multitenant alerts with VictoriaLogs.

> Note: vmalert in VictoriaMetrics Enterprise supports per-group tenants with `-clusterMode`, so it doesn't need this manual VictoriaMetrics cluster path rewrite.

```yaml
    unauthorized_user:
      url_map:
        - src_paths:
          - "/api/v1/query.*"
          url_prefix: "http://vmselect:8481/select/<accountID>/prometheus"
        - src_paths:
          - "/select/logsql/.*"
          url_prefix: "http://victorialogs:9428"
```
