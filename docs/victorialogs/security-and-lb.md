## Security on untrusted networks

All the VictoriaLogs components must run inside a protected trusted network. Requests from the Internet
must be properly authorized before being proxied to VictoriaLogs components. It is recommended using
[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) for the request authorization and load balancing.

It is recommended accepting incoming requests at `vmauth` over https in order to guarantee that they cannot be
read or modified by an attacker when they are transferred over untrusted networks such as Internet.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#tls-termination-proxy) for details.

It is recommended authorizing incoming requests via one of the supported methods at `vmauth` according
to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#authorization).

See also [how to protect security-sensitive HTTP-based endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#system-endpoints).

## Vmauth config examples

This document contains the following configuration examples for `vmauth`:

## Search Authorization

Both [VictoriaLogs single-node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/)
and [vlselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/) expose the same search API endpoints,
which [start with the `/select/` prefix](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api).
When configuring request authorization or load balancing at `vmauth`, it is important to allow access to this path prefix.

The following [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) configuration can be used for authorizing requests
to HTTP querying APIs at VictoriaLogs:

```yaml
users:
- username: "foo"
  password: "bar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix:
    - "http://victoria-logs-1:9428/"
    - "http://victoria-logs-2:9428/"
```

This config instructs `vmauth` accepting requests for the Basic Auth user `foo` with the password `bar`.

Successfully authenticated requests are proxied (load balanced) to one of the VictoriaLogs instances specified in the `url_prefix` list,
if these requests match the `src_paths` regexp, i.e. if they start with `/select/` path prefix.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#routing-by-path) for details about the `src_path`.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#load-balancing) for details about the load balancing.

`victoria-logs-1:9428` and `victoria-logs-2:9428` can be either two VictoriaLogs single-node instances with replicated data
according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#high-availability),
or `vlselect` instances in the [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/).
Enumerate all the `vlselect` instances in the cluster under the `url_prefix` option above in order to spread load among them.

See also [how to set up authorization for data ingestion at VitoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#write-authorization).

### Cluster routing

`vmauth` allows proxying incoming requests to different [VictoriaLogs clusters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/) depending on the request path.
For example:

```yaml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/cold/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-cold:9428/"
    # drop /cold/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1

  - src_paths: ["/hot/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-hot:9428/"
    # drop /hot/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1
```

The configuration above enables proxying requests with the path prefix `/cold/select/` to the backend at `http://victoria-logs-cold:9428`,
and requests with the path prefix `/hot/select/` to the backend at `http://victoria-logs-hot:9428`.
The backends can be either single-node instances of VictoriaLogs or `vmauth` in front of `vlselect` nodes in [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/).
See [how to set up `vmauth` in front on multiple `vlselect` nodes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#search-authorization).

This approach is useful when applying different retention policies for various types of logs.
For example, you might store warn-level and higher severity logs in the cold instance/cluster with longer retention,
while keeping debug-level and lower severity logs only in the hot instance/cluster with shorter retention.

The `drop_src_path_prefix_parts` option is used to remove the prefix from the path when proxying the request to VictoriaLogs.
For example, if vmauth receives a request to `/cold/select/logsql/query`,
VictoriaLogs will receive the path without the `/cold/` prefix, allowing it to properly handle the search query.

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#routing) on how to route requests to different backends.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#dropping-request-path-prefix) about the `drop_src_path_prefix_parts`.

### Tenant-based request proxying

The following `vmauth` config proxies `/select/*` requests with the `AccountID: 0` HTTP header ([tenant](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy))
to the long-term VictoriaLogs instance or cluster, while requests with the `AccountID: 1` HTTP header
are proxied to the short-term VictoriaLogs instance or cluster:

```yaml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:

  # Proxy requests for the given tenant (AccountID=0) to long-term VictoriaLogs
  # and override the ProjectID with 0.
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    src_headers:
    - "AccountID: 0"
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-longterm:9428/"
    headers:
    - "ProjectID: 0"

  # Proxy requests for the given tenant (AccountID=1) to short-term VictoriaLogs
  # and override the AccountID with 0.
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    src_headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-shortterm:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 0"
```

This allows building a VictoriaLogs storage system with distinct per-tenant retention configs
similar to [this one](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/15#issuecomment-3043557052).

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#routing-by-header) on how to setup request routing in `vmauth` by request headers.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#modifying-http-headers) on how to modify request headers before proxying the requests to backends.

See also [tenant-based data ingestion request proxying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#tenant-based-proxying-of-data-ingestion-requests).

### Proxying requests to the given tenants

`vmauth` allows setting (or overriding) http request headers for proxying requests to the given [tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy).
For example, the following `vmauth` configuration overrides tenant headers to `AccountID: 2`, `ProjectID: 4` before proxying requests to the given VictoriaLogs backend:

```yaml
users:
- username: "foo"
  password: "bar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 2"
    - "ProjectID: 4"
```

If the user sets the `AccountID` or `ProjectID` headers to other values, these values are overridden by the values from the config above.

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#modifying-http-headers) on how to modify request headers before proxying the requests to backends.

A more practical example: if you have many tenants and want to separate them by name encoded in the request path,
then `vmauth` configuration might look like this:

```yaml
users:
- username: "foo"
  password: "bar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/my-account/kubernetes-logs/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    - "ProjectID: 5"
    # drop /my-account/kubernetes-logs/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 2

  - src_paths: ["/my-account/mobile-logs/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    - "ProjectID: 6"
    # drop /my-account/mobile-logs/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 2

  - src_paths: ["/my-account/frontend-logs/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    - "ProjectID: 7"
    # drop /my-account/frontend-logs/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 2

- username: "admin"
  password: "secret"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/"
```

This configuration allows user `foo` to access 3 different tenants, and user `admin` to access all tenants.
The user `admin` needs to set the required `AccountID` or `ProjectID` headers, because `vmauth` doesn't set them.

In Grafana you need to create a separate data source for each tenant and user, an example of such an address is: `http://vmauth:8427/my-account/mobile-logs/`.
Using the configuration above, you do not need to set the tenant in the Grafana data source settings because `vmauth` overrides it to `AccountID: 1`, `ProjectID: 6`.
Each tenant exposes [`vmui`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) at `/select/vmui/`, for example: `http://vmauth:8427/my-account/mobile-logs/select/vmui/`.

If you want to restrict users by only one of the tenant fields `AccountID` or `ProjectID`,
it is enough to not specify the corresponding field in the `headers` section.
For example, the following configuration allows user `my-account-admin` to have access to all `ProjectID`s, but only for the given `AccountID`:

```yaml
users:
- username: "my-account-admin"
  password: "foobar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
```

To allows unauthenticated access to the specific tenant, define the `unauthorized_user` as shown below:

```yaml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    - "ProjectID: 7"
```

### Access control inside a single tenant

VictoriaLogs can apply extra filters for each request to the select APIs according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#extra-filters).
This is useful when you need to give access to a subset of data within a single tenant.
If you want hiding a subset of data within a tenant, then specify the HTTP query parameter `extra_filters`
at the `url_prefix` option according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#query-args-handling).

`extra_filters` are enforced globally - they are propagated into all the subqueries inside the provided `query`.
This makes it impossible to bypass the restrictions via `join`, `union`, `in(<query>)` and other [subqueries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#subqueries).

Consider the example below:

```yaml
users:
- username: "foo"
  password: "bar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix:
    - "http://victoria-logs-1:9428/?extra_filters=password:''"
    - "http://victoria-logs-2:9428/?extra_filters=password:''"
```

With this configuration, `vmauth` adds the [empty value filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#empty-value-filter)
`password:''` to each request, which means that the `password` field must be empty or missing in the log.
This is useful in cases when sensitive information has leaked and needs to be hidden.

To restrict log visibility within a specific [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields), use the `extra_stream_filters` query parameter.
The configuration below adds an additional [stream filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter)
to each request based on the request path, and routes `/audit-logs` to a separate VictoriaLogs instance:

```yaml
users:
- username: "frontend-logs-viewer"
  password: "secret"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/?extra_stream_filters=_stream%3A%7Bservice%3Dfrontend-logs%7D"

- username: "mobile-logs-viewer"
  password: "secret"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs:9428/?extra_stream_filters=_stream%3A%7Bservice%3Dmobile-logs%7D"

- username: "audit-logs-viewer"
  password: "secret"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-audit:9428/"
```

`extra_filters` and `extra_stream_filters` should be [percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) when they include characters that are not URL-safe.
For example, the query `_stream:{service=frontend-logs}` should be written as `_stream%3A%7Bservice%3Dfrontend-logs%7D`.

Prefer using `extra_stream_filters` over `extra_filters` whenever possible.
See [LogsQL performance optimization tips](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#performance-tips).

## Write Authorization

Both [VictoriaLogs single-node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/)
and [vlinsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/) expose the same data ingestion API endpoints,
which [start with the `/insert/` prefix](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-apis).
When configuring request authorization or load balancing at `vmauth`, it is important to allow access to this path prefix.

The following [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) configuration can be used for authorizing requests
to HTTP data ingestion APIs at VictoriaLogs:

```yaml
users:
- username: "foo"
  password: "bar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/insert/.*"]
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vlinsert-1:9428/"
    - "http://vlinsert-2:9428/"
```

This config instructs `vmauth` accepting requests for the Basic Auth user `foo` with the password `bar`.

Successfully authenticated requests are proxied (load balanced) to one of the VictoriaLogs instances specified in the `url_prefix` list,
if these requests match the `src_paths` regexp, i.e. if they start with `/insert/` path prefix.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#routing-by-path) for details about the `src_path`.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#load-balancing) for details about the load balancing.

Enumerate all the `vlinsert` instances in the cluster under the `url_prefix` option above in order to spread load among them.

Note that `vmauth` doesn't replicate data amont the backends specified in the `url_prefix` - it spreads (load balances) incoming requests among the configured backends.
Use [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/) for replicating the data to multiple VictoriaLogs instances or multiple VictoriaLogs clusters.

See also [how to set up authorization for search queries at VitoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#search-authorization).

### Tenant assignment

[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) allows proxying requests to different [tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy)
based on the request path. For example, the following `vmauth` configuration proxies incoming data ingestion requests to different tenants
depending on the Basic Auth user:

```yaml
users:
- username: "kubernetes"
  password: "secret"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/insert/.*"]
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vlinsert-1:9428/"
    - "http://vlinsert-2:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    - "ProjectID: 5"
- username: "frontend"
  password: "secret"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/insert/.*"]
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vlinsert-1:9428/"
    - "http://vlinsert-2:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    - "ProjectID: 7"
```

Below is a diagram of this configuration:

![security-and-lb-tenants.webp](security-and-lb-tenants.webp)
{width="600"}

See [how to override http request headers before proxying the requests to backends](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#modifying-http-headers).

### Tenant-based proxying of data ingestion requests

The following `vmauth` config proxies data ingestion requests with the `AccountID: 0` HTTP header
to the long-term VictoriaLogs instance or cluster, while data ingestion requests with the `AccountID: 1` HTTP header
are proxied to the short-term VictoriaLogs instance or cluster:

```yaml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:

  # Proxy data ingestion requests for the given tenant (AccountID=0) to long-term VictoriaLogs
  # and override the ProjectID with 0.
  - src_paths: ["/insert/.*"]
    src_headers:
    - "AccountID: 0"
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-longterm:9428/"
    headers:
    - "ProjectID: 0"

  # Proxy data ingestion requests for the given tenant (AccountID=1) to short-term VictoriaLogs
  # and override the AccountID with 0.
  - src_paths: ["/insert/.*"]
    src_headers:
    - "AccountID: 1"
    url_prefix: "http://victoria-logs-shortterm:9428/"
    headers:
    - "AccountID: 0"
```

This allows building a VictoriaLogs storage system with distinct per-tenant retention configs
similar to [this one](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/15#issuecomment-3043557052).

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#routing-by-header) on how to setup request routing in `vmauth` by request headers.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#modifying-http-headers) on how to modify request headers before proxying the requests to backends.

See also [tenant-based data search request proxying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#tenant-based-request-proxying).

### Adding extra fields

You can use the `extra_fields` parameter in vmauth to automatically add fields to incoming log entries
according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#http-parameters).
This is helpful when the writing side cannot include certain metadata, such as the source service name.

The example below adds a `service` field with the value `frontend-logs` to all the logs received at the `/frontend-logs/insert/*` path.
It also includes the `_stream_fields` parameter as an example of how to configure [stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) for such logs.

```yaml
users:
- bearer_token: "foobar"
  url_map:
  - src_paths: ["/frontend-logs/insert/.*"]
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vlinsert-1:9428/?extra_fields=service=frontend-logs&_stream_fields=service"
    - "http://vlinsert-2:9428/?extra_fields=service=frontend-logs&_stream_fields=service"
    # drop /frontend-logs/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1
```

Any field sent by the application will be overridden by the value set in the `extra_fields`.
This prevents the log shipper from unexpectedly overriding the provided `extra_fields`.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#query-args-handling) for details.

## Basic Auth

It is recommended to run all the VictoriaLogs components in a secure trusted network, and proxying only the properly authorized requests
according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#security-on-untrusted-networks). If you still
want exposing individual VictoriaLogs components to untrusted networks such as Internet, then secure access to them via Basic Auth according to the docs below.

All the VictoriaLogs components support request authentication via [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
for the HTTP requests received at TCP address specified via `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.

Specify the needed username and password via `-httpAuth.username` and `-httpAuth.password` command-line flags in order to enable Basic Auth in any VictoriaLogs component.

**Important note:** HTTP clients send Basic Auth username and password in plaintext, so they could be read by an attacker
if the request is transferred over untrusted network such as Internet. Therefore **always** receive Basic Auth requests over https
and **never** over http. It is recommended to use [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) for receiving requests over untrusted networks.
See [how to enable https at vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#tls-termination-proxy).

**Security Warning:** Passing passwords directly in command-line arguments is not recommended for production,
as they may appear in process listings (e.g., `ps aux`)
or debug endpoints (e.g., `http://victoria-logs:9428/debug/pprof/cmdline?debug=1`).

It is better to provide passwords via files according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#providing-password-from-a-file).

### Providing password from a file

To read passwords from a file instead of command-line arguments, use the `file://` prefix in the corresponding command-line flag:

```sh
./victoria-logs -httpAuth.username=vlstorage -httpAuth.password=file:///path/to/file
```

The value from the file is periodically reloaded, which allows changing the password without restarting the application.

**Note:** the `-httpAuth.username` command-line flag does not support reading values from a file.

Example with [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/) sending Basic Auth requests to [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/):

```sh
./vlagent \
    -remoteWrite.url=https://vmauth:8427/insert/native \
    -remoteWrite.basicAuth.username=vlagent \
    -remoteWrite.basicAuth.passwordFile=/path/to/file
```

To test that vlagent is properly configured with Basic Auth, you can send a test log entry
(use the same password value as configured in `/path/to/file` for `-httpAuth.passwordFile`):

```sh
curl -u "vlagent:$(cat /path/to/file)" http://localhost:9429/insert/jsonline -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"_msg":"Hello, VictoriaLogs!"}'
```

## System endpoints

The following HTTP endpoints at VictoriaLogs components can be protected with keys specified via dedicated `-*AuthKey` command-line flags.
This may be needed if the corresponding VictoriaLogs components are exposed to untrusted networks.

- [`/metrics`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/metrics/) - monitoring endpoint for VictoriaLogs components.
  Use `-metricsAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
- `/flags` - debugging endpoint that shows all active command-line flags.
  Use `-flagsAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
  **Note:** Passwords are hidden in the output of the `/flags` endpoint for security reasons.
- [`/debug/pprof/*`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#profiling) - profiling endpoints for performance analysis.
  Use `-pprofAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
- [`/internal/log_new_streams`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#logging-new-streams) - enables logging new log streams during data ingestion.
  Use `-logNewStreamsAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
- [`/internal/force_flush`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#forced-flush) - forces immediate flushing of in-memory data to disk.
  Use `-forceFlushAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
- [`/internal/force_merge`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#forced-merge) - triggers manual data compaction and merge operations.
  Use `-forceMergeAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).
- [`/internal/partition/*`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#partitions-lifecycle) - manages partition lifecycle operations.
  Use `-partitionManageAuthKey` [command-line flag](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#list-of-command-line-flags).

These endpoints can be accessed by specifying `authKey` query arg with the value matching the corresponding `-*AuthKey` command-line flag.

For example, if VictoriaLogs is started with the `-metricsAuthKey=top-secret` command-line flag, then the `/metrics` endpoint can be accessed with the following command:

```sh
curl 'http://victoria-logs:9428/metrics?authKey=top-secret'
```

Enable HTTPS on the VictoriaLogs components which accept `authKey` in order to prevent from stealing the `authKey` by attackers
who listen for the requests over untrusted networks such as the Internet.
See [how to enable TLS](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#enabling-tls-on-the-server).

## TLS/SSL

While all VictoriaLogs components support receiving HTTP requests over TLS (aka HTTPS),
this isn't needed if the components run in the same trusted private network
according to [the recommendations](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#security-on-untrusted-networks).
Enabling TLS complicates the configuration and slows down communication between components.

If you still want enabling TLS between VictoriaLogs components, then read below.

### Enabling TLS on the server

Pass the following command-line flags to VictoriaLogs component in order to enable receiving HTTPS
requests at the TCP address specified via `-httpListenAddr`:

- `-tls` - this flag instructs enabling TLS
- `-tlsCertFile` - this flag accepts the path to the server TLS certificate file
- `-tlsKeyFile` - this flag accepts the path to the key file for the server TLS certificate

For example, the following command starts VictoriaLogs, which accepts HTTPS requests at the default TCP port `9428`:

```sh
./victoria-logs -tls -tlsCertFile=/path/to/victoria-logs-cert -tlsKeyFile=/path/to/victoria-logs-key
```

See also [how to enable mTLS on any VictoriaLogs component](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#mtls).

### Connecting vlagent to VictoriaLogs with TLS

To send data over TLS, simply change the URL scheme from `http` to `https` in the `-remoteWrite.url`:

```sh
./vlagent -remoteWrite.url=https://localhost:9428/insert/native
```

By default, vlagent verifies server certificates using the system's trusted certificate store.
If using self-signed certificates, you have the following options:

1. Install your CA certificate in the system's trusted certificate store.
1. Specify the CA certificate path manually using `-remoteWrite.tlsCAFile`.

For testing purposes only, you can disable certificate verification with `-remoteWrite.tlsInsecureSkipVerify`.

**Security Warning:** Disabling certificate verification eliminates
protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. Never use this in production.

### Automatic issuing of TLS certificates

All the [VictoriaLogs Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components support automatic issuing of TLS certificates
for public HTTPS server running at `-httpListenAddr` via [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/).
The following command-line flags must be set in order to enable automatic issuing of TLS certificates:

- `-httpListenAddr` must be set for listening TCP port `443`. For example, `-httpListenAddr=:443`.
  This port must be accessible by the [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- `-tls` must be set in order to accept HTTPS requests at `-httpListenAddr`.
  Note that `-tlsCertFile` and `-tlsKeyFile` aren't needed when automatic TLS certificate issuing is enabled.
- `-tlsAutocertHosts` must be set to comma-separated list of hosts, which can be reached via `-httpListenAddr`.
  TLS certificates are automatically issued for these hosts.
- `-tlsAutocertEmail` must be set to contact email for the issued TLS certificates.
- `-tlsAutocertCacheDir` may be set to the directory path for persisting the issued TLS certificates between VictoriaLogs restarts.
  If this flag isn't set, then TLS certificates are re-issued on every restart.

Example of starting VictoriaLogs with automatic TLS certificate issuing:

```sh
./victoria-logs -httpListenAddr=:443 \
    -tls \
    -tlsAutocertHosts=victorialogs.example.com,logs.example.com \
    -tlsAutocertEmail=admin@example.com \
    -tlsAutocertCacheDir=/path/to/tls-cache \
    -licenseFile=/path/to/license
```

### mTLS

> This feature requires [Enterprise binaries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) for VictoriaLogs components that use mTLS.

Mutual TLS ([mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)) requires both client and server to present valid certificates for authentication.
Unlike standard TLS where only the server authenticates itself, mTLS enables bidirectional authentication.

#### Enabling mTLS on the server

mTLS requires both [standard TLS command-line flags for server](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#enabling-tls-on-the-server)
and additional `-mtls` command-line flag:

```sh
./victoria-logs -tls \
    -tlsCertFile=./victoria-logs.pem \
    -tlsKeyFile=./victoria-logs-key.pem \
    -mtls \
    -licenseFile=/path/to/license
```

By default, VictoriaLogs verifies client certificates using the system's trusted certificate store.
If using certificates signed by a private CA not present in the system trust store, you have two options:
1. Install your CA certificate in the system's trusted certificate store.
1. Specify the CA certificate path manually using `-mtlsCAFile` command-line flag.

#### Connecting vlagent to VictoriaLogs with mTLS

Specify `-remoteWrite.tlsCertFile` and `-remoteWrite.tlsKeyFile` command-line flags for the corresponding `-remoteWrite.url`
which requires mTLS. Optionally, specify `-remoteWrite.tlsCAFile`:

```sh
./vlagent -remoteWrite.url=https://vlinsert:9428/insert/native \
    -remoteWrite.tlsCAFile=/path/to/server-ca.pem \
    -remoteWrite.tlsCertFile=/path/to/client-cert.pem \
    -remoteWrite.tlsKeyFile=/path/to/client-key.pem
```

### Certificate reloading

VictoriaLogs automatically re-reads TLS certificate files (server certificates, client certificates, and CA certificates)
without requiring server or client restarts.
Certificate and TLS config values are cached for up to 1 second and then refreshed for new handshakes/requests,
which enables seamless certificate rotation in production environments.

The certificate reloading feature works for:
- Server certificates (`-tlsCertFile` and `-tlsKeyFile`).
- Client certificates (`-storageNode.tlsCertFile`, `-storageNode.tlsKeyFile`, `-remoteWrite.tlsCertFile`, `-remoteWrite.tlsKeyFile`).
- CA certificates (`-mtlsCAFile`, `-storageNode.tlsCAFile`, `-remoteWrite.tlsCAFile`).

To update certificates:
1. Replace the certificate files on disk with new versions.
1. VictoriaLogs will automatically detect and load the updated certificates.
1. New connections will use the updated certificates immediately.
1. Existing connections will continue using the old certificates until they reconnect.
